   <p class="heading-description-j">

      Hello, World! (Get it, a Computer Science joke)

      My name is Keara Cole and I'm a senior at the University of Rhode Island. I am majoring in

      Computer Engineering and Chinese Flagship, and minoring in Computer Science. I chose to study

      engineering to learn how math and patterns help us understand our world, and hope to apply this

      understanding to make it a better and safer place. Additionally, I chose to study Chinese

      because I want to appreciate the difficulty of others learning English, as well as to learn to 

      communicate with 20% of the world in their native language. I will be graduating this May, and will

      be spending the following year taking additional engineering courses and interning at Nanjing University!

<h2 class="heading" id="careergoals"> Career Goals </h2> 

   <p class="heading-description-j">

      "I want to make a difference" is probably a cliche, but it's definitley the best way I can think to outline

      my career goal. My current interests lie in machine learning, network security, biomechanics, 

      artificial intelligence, and robotics. If I could combine helping others with one or more of these passions,

      and maybe even get to use Chinese in the process, I would consider it the perfect job!
